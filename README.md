# Pokemon Game - not yet completed

## Abstract
This game allows users to click on a pokeball- when pokeball is clicked, a wild pokemon will appear and will either be caught or run away, based on random chance. Users can then choose to keep the pokemon in a list.

## Context
I am currently trying to teach myself about fetching from web APIs and I am practicing using the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a>. 

## Learning Goals:
- Practice using async functions, the await keyword, try and catch to get data from a web API
